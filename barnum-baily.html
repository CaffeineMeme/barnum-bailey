  The History of the Barnum and Bailey Circus 
</title>

</head>
  <!--Founded in 1871, The Barnum and Bailey Circus had been traveling around the nation for over 140 years 
until it was closed down in 2017 due to low attendance rates. 
Prior to this, the Barnum and Bailey Circus was created by P.T. Barnum and James A. Bailey. 
The circus has got it’s tagline due to it being described by the public as “The Greatest Show on Earth”. 
Barnum died in 1891, whilst Bailey continued to perform around the country, 
until he died in 1905 and the name was acquired by the Ringling Brothers, another well-known circus company. 
From then on, they performed right beside the Ringling Brothers, however they were still labeled as separate shows. 
After 1956, their shows stop being shown under their portable “big top” tents, and instead went to arena and coliseums. 
In 1967, they were acquired Irvin and Israel Feld, in the Colosseum in Rome, Italy. 
One year afterwards, they also began a “Clown College”, a place where they would train those interested in being clowns,
which operated from 1968 to 1997. 
In 1978, they introduced one of their most famous acts - The Globe of Steel - 
in which a motorcyclist would whizz around the inside of a wireframe metal sphere at 40 mph. 
All was going well, until eventually, around the 2000s, traction to their events began to slow down. 
It got the point where they were no longer able to operate, and they premiered their final show in May 2017,
and closed down shortly afterwards.-->
